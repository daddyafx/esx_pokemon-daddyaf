Use this how you like.

I personally sell the packs at a "card shop", and have it set so you craft specific groups of cards into badges, and then craft the badges into a trophy which players can sell for a high value.

This has been in use in my server for months "Leviathan Roleplay".

example "recipes" will be included in RECIPES text file.
